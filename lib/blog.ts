          Understanding ADHD in children is crucial for providing the right support and guidance during their developmental years. Early recognition and intervention can make a significant difference in a child's academic, social, and emotional growth.

        <h2>What is ADHD?</h2>
        <p>
          Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects children's behavior, attention, and impulse control. While it presents challenges, it's important to understand that ADHD is not a limitation on a child's potential for success.
        </p>

        <h2>Common Signs and Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Inattention:</strong> Difficulty focusing on tasks, easily distracted</li>
          <li><strong>Hyperactivity:</strong> Excessive movement, difficulty staying seated</li>
          <li><strong>Impulsivity:</strong> Acting without thinking, interrupting others</li>
        </ul>
