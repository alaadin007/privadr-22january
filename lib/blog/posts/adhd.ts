          ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in childhood. It affects how children focus, control impulses, and manage their energy levels. While ADHD presents challenges, it's important to understand that it's not a reflection of intelligence or potential.

          Children with ADHD often struggle with:
          - Maintaining attention during tasks or play
          - Following instructions and completing assignments
          - Organizing tasks and managing time
          - Controlling impulses and waiting their turn
